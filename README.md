yourself (or at least thoroughly tried)
- Don't copy the solutions

# Minor notes
- Not all my solutions are in this repo
- All solutions begin with a doc comment giving
the difficulty and the description of the problem
- The solutions are mainly to kyu 4 katas
- The content of the main function is always the content
of the static tests given by codewars.

# Run solutions
